Sure! The XOR (exclusive or) operator evaluates to TRUE if either but not both of its operands are TRUE. Let's break down its behavior and provide an example:

```php
// XOR operator examples
echo "TRUE xor TRUE: " . (TRUE xor TRUE) . "\n";     // Evaluates to: FALSE
echo "FALSE xor TRUE: " . (FALSE xor TRUE) . "\n";   // Evaluates to: TRUE
echo "TRUE xor FALSE: " . (TRUE xor FALSE) . "\n";   // Evaluates to: TRUE
echo "FALSE xor FALSE: " . (FALSE xor FALSE) . "\n"; // Evaluates to: FALSE
```

In the examples above:

- `TRUE xor TRUE`: Both operands are TRUE, so the result is FALSE because both conditions are not exclusive.
- `FALSE xor TRUE`: Only the second operand is TRUE, so the result is TRUE because the conditions are exclusive.
- `TRUE xor FALSE`: Only the first operand is TRUE, so the result is TRUE because the conditions are exclusive.
- `FALSE xor FALSE`: Both operands are FALSE, so the result is FALSE because both conditions are not exclusive.

Now, let's consider a real-world example:

```php
$is_wearing_glasses = TRUE;
$is_wearing_contacts = TRUE;

if ($is_wearing_glasses xor $is_wearing_contacts){
  echo "Your vision is corrected!";
} else {
  echo "Your vision is impaired.";
}
```

In this example, if `$is_wearing_glasses` is TRUE and `$is_wearing_contacts` is TRUE, it means the person's vision is corrected. However, if both are TRUE or both are FALSE (which means either the person is wearing both glasses and contacts or wearing neither), then the vision is impaired.
