Certainly! Here's how you can use the `or` and `and` operators with examples:

### Using the `or` Operator:
```php
$condition1 = TRUE;
$condition2 = FALSE;

// Evaluates to TRUE if either $condition1 or $condition2 is TRUE
$result = $condition1 or $condition2;
echo $result; // Outputs: 1 (TRUE)
```

### Using the `and` Operator:
```php
$condition1 = TRUE;
$condition2 = FALSE;

// Evaluates to FALSE if either $condition1 or $condition2 is FALSE
$result = $condition1 and $condition2;
echo $result; // Outputs: (empty) (FALSE)
```

### Parentheses for Clarification:
```php
$condition1 = TRUE;
$condition2 = FALSE;
$condition3 = TRUE;

// Using parentheses for clarification
$result = ($condition1 or $condition2) and $condition3;
echo $result; // Outputs: 1 (TRUE)
```

In these examples:

- The `or` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if either of its operands is `TRUE`.
- The `and` operator evaluates to `FALSE` if either of its operands is `FALSE`.
- Parentheses can be used to enforce the desired order of evaluation, ensuring clarity in complex expressions.
