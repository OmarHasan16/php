Syllabus
Welcome to Building Web Applications in PHP
, taught by Charles Severance!

In this course, you'll explore the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server. You'll be introduced to the request/response cycle, including GET/POST/Redirect. You'll also gain an introductory understanding of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), as well as the basic syntax and data structures of the PHP language, variables, logic, iteration, arrays, error handling, and superglobal variables, among other elements. An introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will allow you to style markup for webpages. Lastly, you'll gain the skills and knowledge to install and use an integrated PHP/MySQL environment like XAMPP or MAMP.

Community Engagement
We expect everyone to be mindful of what they say and its potential impact on others. The goal is to have respectful discussions that do not violate the community space created for these conversations. Here are some productive ways to engage in this course: 

Participate: This is a community. Read what others have written and share your thoughts.

Stay curious: Learn from experts and each other by listening and asking questions, not making assumptions.

Keep your passion positive: When replying to a discussion forum post, respond with thoughts on what was said, not about the person who posted. Avoid using all caps, too many exclamation points, or aggressive language.

Acknowledge discomfort: The topics discussed in this course might be challenging or hard to talk about. Stick with it and remember the benefits of having these tough conversations that surface from multiple perspectives.

We expect all learners to abide by our full 
Learner Engagement Policy
. We will specifically be monitoring this course for language that could be considered inflammatory, incivil, racist, or otherwise unacceptable for this learning space, and we will remove language deemed such. 

Note regarding “study groups” outside of the platform: While learners are encouraged to interact with one another using communication tools offered within the learning platform, note that any study groups formed outside of this platform, such as over social media or communication applications and websites (e.g., WhatsApp) are not affiliated, endorsed, or moderated by the University of Michigan. If you receive an invitation to an outside study group mentioning the course and claiming to have any official connection to U-M or individual instructors, please exercise caution as this may be an attempted scam.

Academic Honesty
All submitted work should be your own and academic dishonesty is not allowed. Academic dishonesty can be defined as:

Copying words, ideas, or other materials from another source without giving credit to the original author

Copying answers or copying from your peers within the course

Employing or allowing another person to alter or revise your work, and then submitting the work as your own

Using Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, to create or edit your work and submitting that work as your own, unless you were instructed to use AI as part of the assignment

Please don’t share or reuse solutions to assignments which is an academic integrity concern. Please do not:

Share complete assignment code in the course discussion forums

Upload completed assignments to public websites with the goal of sharing solutions. (You can share your work and ideas for professional purposes though).

Take a peer’s solution and submit it as your own

Course Support
Questions and discussion of course material should take place within the course itself. Please do not contact instructors or teaching assistants off the platform, as responding to individual questions is virtually impossible. We encourage you to direct your questions to [forum], where your question might be answered by a fellow learner or one of our course team members. For technical help please contact the 
Coursera Learner Help Center
 or use the support forums.

Accessibility 
We are committed to developing accessible learning experiences for the widest possible audience. We recognize that learners with disabilities (including but not limited to visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, or motor disabilities) might need more specific accessibility-related support to achieve learning goals in this course. 

Please use the 
accessibility feedback form
 to let us know about any accessibility challenges such as urgent issues that keep you from making progress in the course (e.g., missing or inadequate alt-text, captioning errors).

Third-party sites and software: While the University of Michigan is not responsible for the accessibility of third-party sites or applications that may be linked from this course, we still encourage you to report associated third-party accessibility issues so that we can ensure you are able to participate. In such cases, we may contact you for additional information as we investigate ways of removing accessibility barriers or to suggest accessible alternatives.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We welcome all learners to this course. People like you are joining from all over the world and we value this diversity. We strive to create a community of mutual respect and trust, where people from all backgrounds, identities and views are valued and heard without the threat of bias, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination. We pay attention to your feedback, how different types of learners experience this course, and aim to make improvements so the course can best serve everyone. We hope you enjoy learning about topics that are important to you.
