Certainly! Let's break down the use of shorthand syntax for loops in PHP when embedding PHP code in HTML.

### Traditional Loop Syntax

First, let's look at the traditional way of embedding a PHP for loop in HTML. Here's the example you provided:

```php
<ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 2; $i++) { // Start of the loop using curly braces
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
} // End of the loop using curly braces
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>
```

### Shorthand Syntax

Now, let's convert the same loop to use the shorthand syntax. Instead of using curly braces `{}`, we use a colon `:` to start the loop and `endfor;` to end it.

```php
<ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 2; $i++): // Start of the loop using colon
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
endfor; // End of the loop using endfor keyword
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>
```

### Why Use Shorthand?

The shorthand syntax can make your code cleaner and easier to read, especially when you have nested loops or complex structures. It's easier to see where each loop starts and ends without having to match multiple curly braces.

### Example Task

Let's do a task where we convert a traditional for loop to shorthand syntax. Suppose we have the following traditional loop:

```php
<ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) { // Traditional loop to print "We sell shoes" 5 times
?>
<li>We sell shoes</li>
<?php
} // End of the traditional loop
?>
</ul>
```

We need to convert this to the shorthand notation.

### Converted to Shorthand Syntax

Here's how it looks using the shorthand syntax:

```php
<ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++): // Start of the loop using colon
?>
<li>We sell shoes</li>
<?php
endfor; // End of the loop using endfor keyword
?>
</ul>
```

### Explanation

1. **Traditional Syntax**: 
    - We use `{` to start the loop and `}` to end it.
    - It can become hard to track the start and end of the loop, especially with nested loops.

2. **Shorthand Syntax**:
    - We use `:` to start the loop and `endfor;` to end it.
    - This syntax makes it clear where the loop starts and ends, improving readability.

By using the shorthand syntax, you reduce the risk of mismatching brackets and improve the readability of your code, especially when dealing with more complex structures or nested loops.
