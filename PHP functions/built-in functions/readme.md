Built-in PHP functions are powerful tools that allow us to perform various tasks without having to write custom code for them. Let's explore some commonly used built-in functions along with examples:

1. **echo()**: This function is used to output one or more strings.
    ```php
    echo "Hello, world!";
    ```

2. **strlen()**: Returns the length of a string.
    ```php
    $str = "Hello";
    echo strlen($str); // Output: 5
    ```

3. **strtolower()**: Converts a string to lowercase.
    ```php
    $str = "Hello";
    echo strtolower($str); // Output: hello
    ```

4. **strtoupper()**: Converts a string to uppercase.
    ```php
    $str = "Hello";
    echo strtoupper($str); // Output: HELLO
    ```

5. **substr()**: Returns a part of a string.
    ```php
    $str = "Hello, world!";
    echo substr($str, 0, 5); // Output: Hello
    ```

6. **count()**: Returns the number of elements in an array.
    ```php
    $arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    echo count($arr); // Output: 5
    ```

7. **array_push()**: Pushes one or more elements onto the end of an array.
    ```php
    $arr = [1, 2, 3];
    array_push($arr, 4, 5);
    print_r($arr); // Output: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 2 [2] => 3 [3] => 4 [4] => 5 )
    ```

8. **implode()**: Joins array elements with a string.
    ```php
    $arr = ["Hello", "world", "!"];
    echo implode(" ", $arr); // Output: Hello world !
    ```

9. **date()**: Formats a timestamp into a human-readable date.
    ```php
    echo date("Y-m-d"); // Output: Current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
    ```

10. **rand()**: Generates a random integer.
    ```php
    echo rand(1, 100); // Output: A random number between 1 and 100
    ```

These are just a few examples of the many built-in functions available in PHP. As you continue your journey in PHP development, you'll encounter more functions tailored to specific tasks, and you'll learn to leverage them effectively to streamline your code.
