Comments in PHP (and in many other programming languages) are essential for making your code more understandable and maintainable. Here's a breakdown to help you better understand PHP comments:
### Single Line Comments:
```php
// This is a single line comment
echo "Hello, World!"; // This line prints "Hello, World!"

# Another single line comment
$name = "John"; # This line assigns the name "John" to the variable $name
```

### Multi-line Comments:
```php
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span multiple lines
  And everything here won't be executed by PHP
*/
echo "Hello, World!";

/*
  Another multi-line comment
  You can use it to describe a block of code
  Or to temporarily disable multiple lines of code
*/
// echo "This line won't be executed";
// echo "Neither will this one";
```

### Comments for Documentation and Clarity:
```php
// Calculate the sum of two numbers
$number1 = 10; // Assign 10 to $number1
$number2 = 20; // Assign 20 to $number2
$sum = $number1 + $number2; // Add $number1 and $number2 to get the sum
echo "The sum is: " . $sum; // Print the sum

/*
  Function: calculateArea
  Description: Calculates the area of a rectangle
  Parameters:
    - $length: The length of the rectangle
    - $width: The width of the rectangle
  Returns: The area of the rectangle
*/
function calculateArea($length, $width) {
    return $length * $width; // Calculate area
}
```

### Comments for Debugging and Testing:
```php
// Debugging: Uncomment these lines to see the values of variables
// var_dump($number1);
// var_dump($number2);

/*
  Testing: Comment out this block to disable the email sending functionality
  mail($to, $subject, $message);
*/
```
These examples demonstrate how you can use comments for various purposes such as documentation, clarity, debugging, and testing within your PHP code.
