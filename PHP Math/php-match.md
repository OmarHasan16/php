Great summary! Let's encapsulate everything we've covered in this lesson on using numbers in PHP with a quick review and some examples.

### PHP Number Data Types
PHP has two main number data types:
1. **Integers**: Whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal point.
2. **Floating Point Numbers**: Numbers that include a decimal point.

### Arithmetic Operators
Here are the arithmetic operators we can use for performing math operations in PHP:

1. **Addition (`+`)**
   ```php
   echo 1 + 4.5; // Prints: 5.5
   ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**
   ```php
   echo 9 - 1; // Prints: 8
   ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**
   ```php
   echo -1.9 * 2.9; // Prints: -5.51
   ```

4. **Division (`/`)**
   ```php
   echo 9 / 1; // Prints: 9
   ```

5. **Modulo (`%`)**
   ```php
   echo 11 % 3; // Prints: 2
   ```

6. **Exponentiation (`**`)**
   ```php
   echo 8 ** 2; // Prints: 64
   ```

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
Operations in a chain are evaluated based on their precedence:
1. **Parentheses (`()`)**: Operations inside parentheses are evaluated first.
2. **Exponents (`**`)**
3. **Multiplication (`*`) and Division (`/`)**
4. **Addition (`+`) and Subtraction (`-`)**

The acronym **PEMDAS** helps to remember this order.

### Examples
Here are some examples demonstrating the order of operations:

1. **Without Parentheses**
   ```php
   echo 1 + 3 * 9; // Prints: 28 (3 * 9 is evaluated first, then added to 1)
   ```

2. **With Parentheses**
   ```php
   echo (1 + 3) * 9; // Prints: 36 (1 + 3 is evaluated first, then multiplied by 9)
   ```

### Variable Assignment and Operations
You can assign number values to variables and perform operations:

1. **Assignment**
   ```php
   $a = 10;
   $b = 5;
   ```

2. **Operations**
   ```php
   $sum = $a + $b; // $sum is 15
   ```

### Mathematical Assignment Operators
These operators are shorthand for performing operations and reassigning the result to a variable:

1. **Addition Assignment**
   ```php
   $x = 10;
   $x += 5; // Equivalent to $x = $x + $5; $x is now 15
   ```

2. **Subtraction Assignment**
   ```php
   $x = 10;
   $x -= 5; // Equivalent to $x = $x - $5; $x is now 5
   ```

3. **Multiplication Assignment**
   ```php
   $x = 10;
   $x *= 5; // Equivalent to $x = $x * $5; $x is now 50
   ```

4. **Division Assignment**
   ```php
   $x = 10;
   $x /= 5; // Equivalent to $x = $x / $5; $x is now 2
   ```

5. **Modulo Assignment**
   ```php
   $x = 10;
   $x %= 3; // Equivalent to $x = $x % $3; $x is now 1
   ```

### Conclusion
Understanding how to use numbers and arithmetic operations in PHP is fundamental for any PHP developer. Remember the order of operations (PEMDAS) and use assignment operators for more concise and readable code. Practice these concepts to build a strong foundation in PHP programming!
