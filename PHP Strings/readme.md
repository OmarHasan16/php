Making strings more readable in PHP involves several practices that enhance code clarity and maintainability. Here are
some best practices:

1. **Use Concatenation Wisely**: When building complex strings, consider breaking them into multiple lines using
   concatenation (`.`) for readability. Alternatively, you can use double quotes (`"`) for string interpolation.

    ```php
    // Concatenation
    $fullName = $firstName . ' ' . $lastName;

    // String interpolation
    $message = "Hello, $fullName!";
    ```

2. **Escape Characters Properly**: Be mindful of escaping characters, especially when dealing with dynamic content
   within strings to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, or unexpected behavior.

    ```php
    // Properly escaping characters
    $escapedContent = htmlspecialchars($dynamicContent);
    ```

3. **Use HEREDOC or NOWDOC for Multiline Strings**: HEREDOC and NOWDOC syntax can improve the readability of multiline
   strings by allowing you to write them without escaping special characters or using concatenation.

    ```php
    // HEREDOC
    $html = <<<HTML
    <div>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This is a multiline string.</p>
    </div>
    HTML;

    // NOWDOC
    $sqlQuery = <<<'SQL'
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $userId;
    SQL;
    ```

4. **Formatting HTML Strings**: When embedding HTML within PHP strings, consider formatting them for readability using
   indentation and line breaks.

    ```php
    // HTML string with proper formatting
    $html = "<div>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This is a multiline string.</p>
    </div>";
    ```

5. **Use Constants for Reusable Strings**: Define constants for frequently used strings to improve code maintainability
   and make changes easier.

    ```php
    // Define constants for reusable strings
    define('ERROR_MESSAGE', 'An error occurred. Please try again later.');
    ```

6. **Documenting Strings**: Add comments or documentation to clarify the purpose of complex strings, especially if they
   contain placeholders or dynamic content.

    ```php
    // Documenting strings
    $welcomeMessage = "Hello, $username!"; // $username is dynamically populated
    ```

7. **Avoid Concatenating HTML**: When outputting HTML, consider separating PHP logic from HTML markup to improve
   readability and maintainability. Use templating engines like Twig or Blade for more complex views.

    ```php
    // Separating PHP logic from HTML markup
    $pageTitle = "Home";
    include('header.php');
    echo "<h1>$pageTitle</h1>";
    include('footer.php');
    ```
8. **Use concatenation**: Concatenating strings using the `.` operator can make code more readable than using complex
   interpolation or concatenation functions like `sprintf()`. It's straightforward and easy to understand.

   ```php
   // Concatenation
   $fullName = $firstName . ' ' . $lastName;

   // Complex interpolation (not recommended for readability)
   $fullName = "{$firstName} {$lastName}";

   // sprintf (not recommended for simple cases)
   $fullName = sprintf('%s %s', $firstName, $lastName);
   ```

9. **Choose clear delimiter**: When working with strings that contain special characters or quotes, choose a delimiter
   that makes the string easier to read. For example, if your string contains single quotes, use double quotes as the
   delimiter and vice versa.

   ```php
   // Clear delimiter
   $message = "It's a beautiful day.";

   // Ambiguous delimiter (not recommended)
   $message = 'It\'s a beautiful day.';
   ```

10. **Escape characters when necessary**: Use escape characters to make strings containing special characters or
    reserved characters more readable and unambiguous.

```php
// Escape characters
$escapedString = "This string contains a \"quote\" and a \n newline character.";
```

11. **Use heredoc or nowdoc for multi-line strings**: When dealing with multi-line strings, using heredoc or nowdoc
    syntax can make the code more readable and maintainable than manually concatenating lines.

```php
// Heredoc syntax
$multiLineString = <<<EOT
This is a multi-line
string using heredoc syntax.
EOT;

// Nowdoc syntax
$multiLineString = <<<'EOT'
This is a multi-line
string using nowdoc syntax.
EOT;
```

12. **Avoid overly long lines**: Break long strings into multiple lines to improve readability. This is especially
    important for strings that exceed the recommended line length.

```php
// Long string broken into multiple lines
$longString = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.";
```

13. **Use meaningful variable names**: When storing strings in variables, use descriptive names to indicate their
    purpose, making the code more self-explanatory.

```php
// Descriptive variable names
$welcomeMessage = "Welcome to our website!";
```

By following these best practices, you can write PHP code with strings that are more readable, maintainable, and less
error-prone.
