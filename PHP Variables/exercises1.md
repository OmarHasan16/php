Here are some assignments and exercises related to PHP variables:

1. **Variable Declaration and Printing:**
   - Declare a variable named `$name` and assign your name to it. Print the value of the variable.
   - Declare variables `$age` and `$city` and assign appropriate values. Print them.

2. **Variable Types:**
   - Declare variables of different types: integer, float, string, boolean.
   - Print out the variables along with their types using `var_dump()`.

3. **Variable Manipulation:**
   - Create two variables `$num1` and `$num2` and assign them integer values.
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these variables and print the results.

4. **Concatenation:**
   - Declare two variables `$firstName` and `$lastName` and assign your first name and last name to them respectively.
   - Concatenate these variables to form a full name and print it.

5. **Variable Scope:**
   - Declare a variable `$globalVar` outside of any function and assign it a value.
   - Write a function that tries to print the value of `$globalVar` from within the function.
   - Call the function and observe the output.

6. **Global and Local Variables:**
   - Declare a global variable `$globalVar` and assign it a value.
   - Write a function that tries to print the value of `$globalVar` from within the function.
   - Call the function and observe the output.

7. **Variable Constants:**
   - Define a constant named `PI` and assign it the value of Pi (3.14).
   - Use the constant `PI` to calculate the area of a circle with a given radius and print the result.

8. **Variable Interpolation:**
   - Create variables for `$firstName` and `$lastName` and assign your first and last names.
   - Use string interpolation to create a greeting message using these variables and print it.

9. **Variable References:**
   - Declare a variable `$num` and assign it an integer value.
   - Create a reference variable `$refNum` that references `$num`.
   - Change the value of `$num` and observe the changes in `$refNum`.

10. **Variable Data Filtering:**
- Create a form with input fields for name, email, and age.
- Use PHP to retrieve the form data.
- Filter and sanitize the input data using appropriate PHP functions.
- Print out the sanitized data.

These exercises cover various aspects of PHP variables and will help you gain a solid understanding of working with them. Happy coding!
