Here are some more assignments and exercises related to PHP variables for you to practice:

1. **Variable Scope:**
   Write a PHP script to demonstrate the difference between local and global variables. Declare a global variable outside of any function, then declare a local variable within a function. Try to access both variables from within the function.

2. **Variable Manipulation with User Input:**
   Create a form with input fields for two numbers and a select dropdown for an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Use PHP to retrieve the form data and perform the selected operation on the two numbers. Print out the result.

3. **Variable Data Conversion:**
   Declare a variable with a numeric value. Convert it to a string and print out the result. Then, convert it back to a numeric value and print it out again to verify the conversion.

4. **Variable Interpolation:**
   Declare a variable with a numeric value. Create a string that includes the variable's value using variable interpolation. Print out the string.

5. **Variable Constants:**
   Define a constant variable using the `define()` function and assign it a value. Then, try to change the value of the constant variable and observe the result.

6. **Variable Variables:**
   Declare a variable with a string value that represents the name of another variable. Create a new variable using the value of the first variable as its name. Assign a value to the new variable and print it out.

7. **Variable Arrays:**
   Create an associative array with keys as variable names and values as their corresponding values. Loop through the array and print out each variable name and its value.

8. **Variable Data Types and Functions:**
   Write a PHP script that demonstrates the use of various functions to determine the data type of a variable (`gettype()`), check if a variable is of a certain type (`is_int()`, `is_float()`, `is_string()`, `is_bool()`), and convert variables between data types (`intval()`, `floatval()`, `strval()`, `boolval()`).

9. **Variable Initialization and Checking:**
   Declare a variable without assigning a value to it. Check if the variable is set using `isset()` function. If it's not set, assign a default value to it and print out the variable.

10. **Variable Constants and Magic Constants:**
    Use predefined PHP constants like `__LINE__`, `__FILE__`, `__DIR__`, and `__FUNCTION__` within your script to display line number, file path, directory path, and function name respectively.

These exercises cover various aspects of PHP variables and will help you strengthen your understanding and skills.
