Here is more PHP constants exercises for further practice:

11. **Mathematical Constant**: Define a constant called `EULER_NUMBER` with the value `2.71828`.

12. **Use a Constant in Calculation**: Use the constant `EULER_NUMBER` to calculate the value of \( e^3 \). Store the result in a variable called `$result`.

13. **Define a Boolean Constant**: Define a constant called `ENABLE_FEATURE` with the value `true`.

14. **Check Boolean Constant**: Check if the constant `ENABLE_FEATURE` is `true`. If it is, echo "Feature is enabled"; otherwise, echo "Feature is disabled".

15. **Array Constant**: Define a constant called `FRUITS` as an array containing the fruits "Apple", "Banana", and "Orange". Display the contents of the `FRUITS` array using `print_r()`.

16. **Predefined Constant**: Display the maximum integer value that can be represented in PHP using the predefined constant `PHP_INT_MAX`.

17. **Magic Constant with Include**: Create another PHP file named `included_file.php`. Inside this file, echo the magic constant `__FILE__`. Then, include this file in your main PHP script and observe the output.

18. **Predefined Constant with Include**: Include the PHP file `included_file.php` from the previous exercise. Then, display the PHP version using the predefined constant `PHP_VERSION`.

19. **Check if a Constant is Case-Sensitive**: Define a constant called `MY_CONSTANT` with a value of `"Hello"`. Then, check if the constant `my_constant` (note the case difference) is defined in a case-sensitive manner.

20. **Environment-dependent Constant**: Define a constant called `ENVIRONMENT` with a value of `"development"` if the script is running on a local development server (localhost) or `"production"` if it's running on a live production server. Display the value of the `ENVIRONMENT` constant.

These exercises cover a variety of scenarios where constants can be used in PHP programming, from simple mathematical calculations to environment-dependent configurations. Happy practicing!
