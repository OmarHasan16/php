PHP constants exercises for practice:

1. **Define a Constant**: Define a constant called `PI` with the value `3.14159`.

2. **Use a Constant in Calculation**: Use the constant `PI` to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of `5`. Store the result in a variable called `$area`.

3. **String Constant**: Define a constant called `GREETING` with the value `"Hello, world!"`. Echo this constant to the screen.

4. **File Path Constant**: Use the `__FILE__` magic constant to display the full path and filename of the current file.

5. **Directory Path Constant**: Use the `__DIR__` magic constant to display the full directory path of the current file.

6. **PHP Version Constant**: Display the current PHP version using the predefined constant `PHP_VERSION`.

7. **Operating System Constant**: Display the current operating system using the predefined constant `PHP_OS`.

8. **End of Line Constant**: Display the end of line character(s) using the predefined constant `PHP_EOL`.

9. **Check if a Constant is Defined**: Check if the constant `SITE_NAME` is defined. If it is, echo its value; otherwise, echo a message indicating that the constant is not defined.

10. **Case-insensitive Constant Comparison**: Define a constant called `MY_CONSTANT` with a value of `"Hello"`. Check if the constant `my_constant` (note the case difference) is defined, and if it is, echo its value; otherwise, echo a message indicating that the constant is not defined.

These exercises cover a range of scenarios where constants can be useful in PHP programming. Have fun practicing!
