# Laragon SSL not working (Windows 10/11)
When you install the fresh Laragon installation, copy your `www` and `data` folders, launch your dev sites, your browser might notify you about an invalid SSL certificate.

## Solution
Right click on `Laragon / Apache / SSL` and make sure it is enabled and click `Add laragon.crt to Trust Store`!
